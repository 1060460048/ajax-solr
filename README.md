# AJAX Solr

AJAX Solr is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces to
[Apache Solr][1].

* [Project Page][3]
* [Documentation][4]
* [Wiki][2]

It is JavaScript framework-agnostic, but requires an AJAX implementation to
communication with Solr. As such, you may use the library whether you develop
using jQuery, MooTools, Prototype, Dojo, or any other framework. You need only
define a Manager object that extends the provided AbstractManager object, and
define the function executeRequest() on that object. A jQuery-compatible Manager
is provided at managers/Manager.jquery.js.

AJAX Solr began as a fork of [SolrJS][5] by Matthias Epheser. We are indebted to
that project for providing a great starting point for improvement.

## How do I get started?

Read the [documentation][3], the [wiki][2] and explore the code for now. More
examples and a demo site are pending.

We have currently written widgets that use jQuery and integrate with Drupal.
Release pending.

Documentation is generated by [JsDoc Toolkit][6] with the command: `java -jar
jsrun.jar app/run.js -a -E="jquery.strftime.js" -p -r=3 -s -t=templates/jsdoc
/path/to/library/`

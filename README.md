# AJAX Solr

AJAX Solr is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces to
[Apache Solr][1].

## How do I get started?

Read the [documentation][2], the [wiki][3] and explore the code for now. More
examples and a demo site are pending.

We have currently written widgets that use jQuery and integrate with Drupal.
Release pending.

Documentation is generated by [JsDoc Toolkit][4] with the command: `java -jar
jsrun.jar app/run.js -a -p -r=3 -s -t=templates/jsdoc
/path/to/library/`
